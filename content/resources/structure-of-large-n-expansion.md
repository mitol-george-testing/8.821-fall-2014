**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu continues discussion of theories whose fields are built out of matrices. When the rank N of the matrices become large, observables can be expanded in 1 / N. This large-N expansion can be organized in terms of topology of Feynman diagrams.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
