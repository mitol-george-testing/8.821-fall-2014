**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu introduces the definition of D-branes, finds spectrum of open strings on D-branes, which can be interpreted as excitations of D-branes. Among excitations are massless vector fields whose low energy effective actions are given by a U(1) gauge theory.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
