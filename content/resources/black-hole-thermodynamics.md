**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu first discusses four laws of black hole mechanics, and then relates them to laws of thermodynamics. This shows that a black hole is a thermal object with not only temperature, but also entropy. He also outlines the black hole information paradox.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
