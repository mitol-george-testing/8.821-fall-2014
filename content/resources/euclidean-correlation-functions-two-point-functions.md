**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu first motivates a prescription for obtaining Euclidean correlation functions of the boundary theory from bulk gravity. He then discusses in details the computation of two-point functions as an illustration of how the prescription works.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
