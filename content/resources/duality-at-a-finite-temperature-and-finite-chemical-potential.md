**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu first discusses an important prediction of the duality for a boundary field theory at a finite temperature: Hawking-page transition, i.e. a finite temperature boundary system should exhibit a first order phase transition as the temperature is raised in the large N limit. Near the end, he briefly discusses how the duality works if the boundary system has a finite chemical potential.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
