**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu first continues the discussion of Euclidean correlation functions by outlining how the prescription works for higher-point functions. In the second half, he starts the discussion of how to evaluate the Wilson loop of a boundary theory using the corresponding AdS string theory.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
