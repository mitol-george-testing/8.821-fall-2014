**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu first discusses closed string spectrum obtained from light-cone quantization. The essential point is that among closed string excitation there is a massless spin-2 particle, which can be interpreted as the graviton. He then briefly discusses string interactions which confirms the interpretation of the graviton.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
