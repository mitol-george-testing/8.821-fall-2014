**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu wraps up the mathematical connection between 1 / N expansion of a large N matrix field theory with the perturbative expansion of a string theory. The second half of this lecture starts Part 2 of the course, the first topic of which is an introduction to string theory.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
